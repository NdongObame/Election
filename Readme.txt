Legislative elections
Our election is subject the following rule:
when one of the candidates obtains more than 50% of the votes, he is elected in the first round.
In the case of a second round, only candidates obtaining at least 12,5% of the votes in the first ballot
can participate.
We have only five candidates in the competition and each candidate is identifiable by one colour, namely
"<GREEN," "< YELLOW," "BLUE," "WHITE" and "< RED ">.
Write an algorithm that allows the entry of the votes of each of the five candidates competing in the first round.
then translate the vote scores into percentages before displaying them.
And give the verdict of only candidate << "YELLOW " specifying whether he is elected in the first round, whether
he is defeated in the first round or whether he goes to the second round in a strong or weak position.
